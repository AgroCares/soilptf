\title{Calculate the Plant Available Water (PAW) given the pedotransferfunction of Szabo et al.2021
The RF-model based prediction can be calculated using the R package euptf2 (https://github.com/tkdweber/euptf2/)
Note YF 20220928: It may be better to copy-paste codes and RF model results from euptf2,
# so that we have no dependency on euptf2 package?
Note YF 20220929: The function 'euptfFun' does not work when the data frame has only 1 row ?!}
\usage{
sptf_paw7(A_C_OF, A_CLAY_MI, A_SILT_MI, A_SAND_MI)
}
\arguments{
\item{A_C_OF}{(numeric) Organic Carbon Content (g / kg)}

\item{A_CLAY_MI}{(numeric) The clay content of the mineral soil fraction (\%).}

\item{A_SILT_MI}{(numeric) Silt content (\%)}

\item{A_SAND_MI}{(numeric) Sand content (\%)}
